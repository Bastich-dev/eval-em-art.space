Do I need another web host?

    No. All Art.Space plans include our fully-managed cloud hosting, ensuring your website remains available at all times.

Can I download Squarespace?

    No. Art.Space is a fully-managed web service. We do not have plans to make a downloadable version. Art.Space does provide many standard methods for exporting your data.

Do you offer email accounts?

    While Art.Space does not provide email accounts, you can easily link your domain to Google Apps and get free email.

How do I sign up?

    You start with a free trial. We don't collect your credit card until you've determinated Squarespace is the right product for you.

How do I cancel service?

    Canceling Art.Space is an easy and no-questions-asked process. It's done online right from your site manager.

Can I switch plans?
    
    Yes, at any time, in your website manager. When upgrading or downgrading your website plan, you will receive either a pro-rated charge or refung, depending on the cost of your new plan.

What is meant by unlimited?

    Certain Art.Space packages do not have resource limits for normal usage. As per our Terms of Service, sites cannot exist for the sole purpose of file sharing.
